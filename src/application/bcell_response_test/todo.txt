How do B Cells get info about the fight?
 - “naive B cells require accessory signals that can come either from an armed helper T cell or, in some cases,
    directly from microbial constituents.” [1]

In this case let's assume that T Cells are the ones activating the B cells.

Need:
- B Cells just hanging out casually
- T Cells sending out Cytokines
- If a B cell is naive, then it will begin to produce antibodies to combat the antigen
- ? The antibodies are then sent to combat the virus
