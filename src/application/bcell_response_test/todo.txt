How do B Cells get info about the fight?
 - “naive B cells require accessory signals that can come either from an armed helper T cell or, in some cases,
    directly from microbial constituents.” [1]

In this case let's assume that T Cells are the ones activating the B cells.

Need:
x B Cells just hanging out casually
- T Cells sending out Cytokines
x If a B cell is naive, then it will begin to produce antibodies to combat the antigen
x ? The antibodies are then sent to combat the virus
x ? B cell should go away, memory cells are left in place
- Memory cells

What if we represented our model the following way:
A cytokine lands on a b cell. There are two different things that can happen.
1. The B cell is not naive.
    1a. Cell releases antibodies
    1b. OR Cell ignores the cytokine
2. The B cell is naive.
    1a. Cell produces antibodies
    1b. Cell releases antibodies and leaves behind memory cells

The memory cells or B cells that are not naive.
